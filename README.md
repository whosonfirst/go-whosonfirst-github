# go-whosonfirst-github

Go package for working with Who's On First GitHub repositories.

## Important

Here's a weird thing. If you try to use this code, either via the CLI tools or in your own packages, using `go run ... ` it will fail with incomprehensible "bad file descriptor" errors whenever the `google/go-github` code tries to make an HTTP request. If you compile things and run the same code as a binary everything works fine. Computers, amirite?

## Tools

_All of the webhook tools need some documentation loving..._

#### wof-list-hooks

_Please write me_

#### wof-update-hook

_Please write me_

```
./bin/wof-update-hook -token {TOKEN} -hook-url {URL} -hook-secret {NEW_SECRET} -org whosonfirst-data -repo whosonfirst-data-venue-us-il
```

You can also update webhooks for all of the repositories in an organization by passing the `-repo '*'` flag. You can still filter the list of repos by setting the `-prefix` flag.

```
./bin/wof-update-hook -token {TOKEN} -hook-url {URL} -hook-secret {NEW_SECRET} -org whosonfirst-data -repo '*' -prefix whosonfirst-data

## Caveats

### Things this package doesn't deal with (yet)

* Anything that requires a GitHub API access token
* Anything other than the `master` branch of a repository
* The ability to exclude specific repositories
